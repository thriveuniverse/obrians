It's a reminder that quality doesn't need a global factory; it thrives in small batches, skilled hands, and imagination. Post-crisis or pre-, that's the life we want: flavorful, natural, and full of character."

No matter what the outside world throws at us, we adapt, enjoy, and keep the fire (or the tap) going."
